# Average temperature
Make a program that shows the average temperatures for Helsinki (the full year). Write that information to the console. Here is how you create an array object containing the average temperatures for all twelve months (January, February,...).

```
let temperatures = [-3.3, -4.7, -1.3, 3.9, 10.2, 14.6, 17.8, 16.3, 11.5, 6.6, 1.6, -2.0]; // let declaration for Viope. Viope tests many arrays
```

Sample output:
