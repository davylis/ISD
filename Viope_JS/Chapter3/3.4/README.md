# String Concatenation

String concatenation is the operation of joining character strings end-to-end. For example, the concatenation of "text" and "book" is "textbook". You can use the + operator to concatenate strings.

Define the following four variables: fullName, part1, part2, and part3. Assign "Haaga" to part1, assign "-" to part2, and assign "Helia" to part3. Next, concatenate part1, part2 and part3 together, and assign the result to the variable fullName. Finally, write the value of variable fullName into the browser console.
