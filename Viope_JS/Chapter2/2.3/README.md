# Event Listener
In HTML, a clickable button is marked up as follows: <button>Click me!</button> To execute JavaScript code when the user clicks on the button you attach an event listener to the button. An event listener is a JavaScript function that gets automatically called when the user clicks the button.


    Add a new button tag to your HTML document. The button tag should be inside < body>. The id of the button should be "btnlog". The text shown on the button should be "LOG HELLO". When the user clicks the button the function buttonClicked() should be called.
    In your JavaScript code, write a function called buttonClicked(). When the function is called it should write the text "Hello!" into the browser console.
